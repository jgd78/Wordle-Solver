Optimal wordle game guesses
This program is used to calculate the optimal guesses for the popular browser game Wordle, found at Wordle.com.

Wordle is a popular web game where the player has 6 tries to guess the daily "secret" five letter word. With each try, the player is told some information to help narrow down the choices. Once entered as a guess, the letters in the word the player guessed will change colors. A green letter indicates that that letter is in the "secret" word and is currently in the correct position (i.e. the first, second, etc. position). A yellow letter indicates that that letter is in the "secret" word but is currently in the wrong position. A gray letter indicates that that letter is not in the word at all. 
(Note: there are some edge cases with the gray letter rule, especially pertaining to double letters in the same word. For example, if the secret word is "ample" and one guesses "puppy", the sequence of letters in puppy will be gray, gray, green, gray, gray. The first and third p's are gray even though 'p' is in the word. That is because the second 'p' is green and so the gray first and third 'p' indicate that there is not a second 'p' in the secret word. Additionally, if the secret word was "space" and one guessed "puppy", only the first 'p' would be yellow, and the other two would be gray, indicating the presence of only one 'p' in the secret word. If more than one 'p' turned yellow, that would indicated two p's in the secret word, but that neither was in the correct position.)

Using the list of over 13,000 words accepted by Wordle as a valid guess, this program calculates which guess (on average) will narrow down your possible words the most. Simply run the program to open a GUI to enter in your guess and the colors of the tiles associated with that guess. For example, the best possible first guess has previously been calculated to be "salet". You could in theory use this program yourself to check that, however it would take an extremely long time to run as it would have to check all 13,000 words against each other along with every possible combination of green, yellow, and gray tilings. Regardless, you do not need to start with "salet", you can choose whichever word you would like. Enter your starting word into Wordle.com and see what colors the tiles are now. Then to calculate your enxt guess, you would enter this information into the GUI. In the entry box under "Your guess:" you would enter the word you guessed (so personally for me, first it would be "salet") then in the entry box beneath the label "Order of colors", you would record the colors of the boxes returned to you by Wordle.com in the format of a five letter string of g's, y's and b's representing green, yellow, and gray tiles (i use 'b' for gray which stands for black because green and gray both start with the letter g). So if i were to type salet into wordle and press enter, and the 's' and 'l' turned green and the 'e' turned yellow, i would type "salet" into the left entry window and gbgyb into the right entry box. Then, click enter and window will appear labeled "Next guess(es)" where a list of your top 5 guesses from best to worst will be shown. Then simply type a word of your choosing into wordle (it doesnt even have to be any of these words), enter it into wordle to get your colors for that word, and repeat the process. You can continue this process until you find the correct word as indicated by Wordle.com. When you are ready to play again, either close and reopen the program, or just pressthe button labeled "Reset game". 

(A second note: this only works 100% effectively for the online game wordle as i was able to accesss the list of  accepted words for the official Wordle.com page. Some words accepted by Wordle.com may not be accepted by other websites such as wordleunlimited.com. However, i hope to implement a feature that initially asks one for the name of a text file containing a list of possible words to play with to broaden the functionality of the program, so it may even work on games such as bigwordle, a game where the player can play wordle but with words of longer length.)
